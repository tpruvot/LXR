# IMPORTANT!
#	If LXR is offered as part of an existing server defined in another
#	configuration file, DO NOT use this one.
#	Instead, extract the location paragraphs and transfer them into
#	that other configuration file.
#
#	Servers are considered identical (and thus conflict) if they
#	have the same name and operate on the same port.

#
#	This location directive manages both the virtual root and tree
#	(in multiple trees context) identifications. It is configured
#	for the built-in policy where tree designation is put after the
#	virtual root in the URL as (remember that location's omit the
#	"scheme", hostname and port):
#
#	/virtual_root/tree/script/arguments   for "embedded" case
#	/virtual_root/script/arguments        other cases
#
#	Pattern matching is used to isolate the different components:
#	^     virtrootbase /   [^/]+  /  (.*)    $
#	start ----root----   treename   URLtail end
#
#	If you don't use the built-in policy, you must adapt the following
#	regular expression to your needs.

#@IF		'S' ne "%_routing%" && 'E' ne "%_routing%"
	location ~ ^%virtrootbase%/(.*)$
#@ELSEIF	'E' eq "%_routing%"
#@	IF	'c' eq "%_virtrootpolicy%"
#@		REMIND Remember to adapt the tree designation for nginx
#@	ENDIF

#
#	Next, we must handle differently "ordinary" files (like stylesheets
#	or images) and scripts files.
# 	This alias directive serves the ordinary files.
#	Note we don't use root directive because we must replace the head
#	part of the path.
		alias %LXRroot%/$1;

#	Script files will be handled by FastCGI.
#	Scripts are first identified by a more specific regular expression
#	whose head is similar to the previous one. See above for its structure
#	and the warning about the multiple trees policy.
