Hacking LXR
-----------

The internals of LXR are described in the Developer's Manual
separately downloadable.

Information can also be grabbed from the comments in the source code
or from embedded POD, aka. Perl's Plain Old Documentation
(see http://lxr.sourceforge.net/lxr_internal_doc for a copy of this
documentation).
